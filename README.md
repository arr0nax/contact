## Description

_This application can take and store contact information. Every contact is created as a new Contact object, and is stored in a session array called 'list_of_contacts'. Contacts are accessed using a getAll() function for displaying, and using their array index in 'list_of_contacts' for individual editing and deleting. To access and edit a contact, simply click on it and a form will appear giving you the option to replace information or delete the contact entirely._
